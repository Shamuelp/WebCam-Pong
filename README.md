# WebCam-Pong
*You will be able to play the classic Pong using your webcam to control the paddle!*

You can control it with the following gestures:

Your open hand (5 fingers): The paddle moves up.
Your open hand (4 fingers): The paddle moves down.
Your closed hand: The paddle stays still.

Three windows will open. One of them shows the detection of your handâ€”place it in front of your webcam to start generating inputs and begin playing.
